12:03:43 §e[NPC] §aHungry Hiker§f: §r§fHello there, I seem to be stuck here with no good food to eat, could you bring me some square orange fruits?
12:03:49 §e[NPC] §aHungry Hiker§f: §r§fI guess I'll just go hungry then...
12:03:50 §e[NPC] §9Vinyl Collector§f: §r§fHey man, I just need one more vinyl to complete the full Pest Vinyl collection.
12:04:31 §e[NPC] §aPlumber Joe§f: §r§fI once dumped a magical water bucket into the toilet. It won't stop overflowing. Anyway, you got something for me?
12:04:38 §e[NPC] §aPlumber Joe§f: §r§fI guess I'll just try to fix it myself.
12:04:38 §e[NPC] §aTerry§f: §r§fAhoy, §aHotBaconWasTaken§f! People always tell me they like ice cream, but ice never really tastes like anything for me!
12:04:44 §e[NPC] §aTerry§f: §r§fI'll keep crunching on those ice cubes, maybe I am missing something.
12:04:45 §e[NPC] §aLiam§f: §r§fOne day you'll be able to buy the sun, trust me on that mate.
12:04:49 §e[NPC] §aLiam§f: §r§fAlright...
12:06:14 §e[NPC] §9Vinyl Collector§f: §r§fFinally! Thanks man, now I have another complete set!
12:07:01 §e[NPC] §9Rusty§f: §rEver wondered how I find all the things that other players lost? I outsource it. Right now, someone is looking for their §9Polished Pumpkin§f. Can you find that for me?
12:07:07 §e[NPC] §9Rusty§f: §r§fTurns out, if you want something done, you have to do it yourself.
13:30:25 §e[NPC] §aPest Wrangler§f: §r§fThere's pests everywhere. I can smell 'em in the walls!
13:30:32 §e[NPC] §aPest Wrangler§f: §r§fThanks mate, this should help me catch 'em!
13:30:33 §e[NPC] §aFisherman§f: §r§fA Carrot King has been scaring off all the good fish, I need to deal with it before I lose more fish.
13:30:35 §e[NPC] §aFarmhand§f: §r§fI took a break from work for too long! Now I need your help to meet my quota!
13:30:36 §e[NPC] §aJamie§f: §r§fYou might have noticed that you can purchase additional plots within your Desk in the Barn!
13:30:38 §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fI don't really have a sweet tooth, but chocolate is probably my favorite thing in this world. But the supply is really poor mostly because of the mines' lack of accessibility.
13:30:48 §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fI helped you enter the Crystal Hollows so many times! Why won't you return the favor?
13:30:52 §e[NPC] §aJamie§f: §r§fNo worries.
13:31:02 §e[NPC] §aFisherman§f: §r§fS'alright, we are all busy some days.
13:31:04 §e[NPC] §aFarmhand§f: §r§fYou condemn me to doing my own work? How can you do this to me!
20:27:50 §e[NPC] §aGuy§f: §r§fHeard you may got some mushrooms...I've been looking for some...
20:27:54 §e[NPC] §aGuy§f: §r§fOh man gee, that's awful man, call me when you got 'em alright?
20:27:55 §e[NPC] §9Bartender§f: §r§fI want to make some new brews, do you think you can give me some ingredients to work with?
20:27:59 §e[NPC] §9Bartender§f: §r§fHard times we are in. Take care!
20:27:59 §e[NPC] §aLiam§f: §r§fOne day you'll be able to buy the sun, trust me on that mate.
20:28:03 §e[NPC] §aLiam§f: §r§fAlright...
20:28:03 §e[NPC] §aRhys§f: §r§fI found an unexplored cave while mining for titanium. But it's too dark to see in there, even for me! Can you spare any glowing pumpkins?
20:28:06 §e[NPC] §aRhys§f: §r§fWell then, I will even mine in total darkness if I must!
20:28:07 §e[NPC] §aFarmhand§f: §r§fI took a break from work for too long! Now I need your help to meet my quota!
20:28:09 §e[NPC] §aFarmhand§f: §r§fYou condemn me to doing my own work? How can you do this to me!
21:01:15 §e[NPC] §6Jerry§f: §rHello §aHotBaconWasTaken§f. Glad to meet you here. I need some §aEnchanted Baked Potato§f.
21:01:48 §e[NPC] §6Jerry§f: §r§fThis is not my realm. I must return. Thank you.
21:01:49 §e[NPC] §aFriendly Hiker§f: §r§fI'm planning to head back into the gorge to fetch my hiker friend, but I'll need some meat to cook before I head in there.
21:01:53 §e[NPC] §aFriendly Hiker§f: §r§fThat's alright. I can always head into the Oasis to hunt down some sheep.
21:01:54 §e[NPC] §aDuke§f: §rYou seem new here. You should probably try to get some §aEnchanted Cactus Green §ffor me.
21:01:56 §e[NPC] §aDuke§f: §r§fMaybe next time.
23:18:54 §e[NPC] §aVex§f: §r§fI have an offer for you that you can't refuse.
23:19:01 §e[NPC] §aVex§f: §r§fOh well that's awkward.
23:19:02 §e[NPC] §aWeaponsmith§f: §r§fHey! I am looking to make some Hot Potato Books to enhance some of my weapons, do you have any potatoes to spare?
23:19:07 §e[NPC] §aWeaponsmith§f: §r§fToo bad, I guess I'll have to look for actual metal next time...
23:19:08 §e[NPC] §aAdventurer§f: §r§fExploring the whole wide world makes me hungry, I could take some fresh potatoes.
23:19:13 §e[NPC] §aAdventurer§f: §r§fDarn it, I'll have to find another farmer then.
23:19:13 §e[NPC] §aAndrew§f: §rDid you know that SkyBlock has been running for §b4456 §fin-game months already? Time flies.
23:19:16 §e[NPC] §aAndrew§f: §r§fI guess I'll come back in a bit.
23:19:16 §e[NPC] §aLibrarian§f: §r§fGreetings! I've been running low on paper recently for my Enchanted Books, could you bring me some Sugar Cane?
23:19:24 §e[NPC] §aLibrarian§f: §r§fVery unfortunate, I really needed that paper...
