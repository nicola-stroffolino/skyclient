13:43:12 §e[NPC] §9Emissary Sisko§f: §r§fI've heard I can find the best mushrooms here, and as the King's favorite emissary I will bring them to him!
13:43:15 §e[NPC] §aJotraeline Greatforge§f: §r§fI heard you have a composter in your barn, it happens to run on the same fuel drills run on! Could I check it out?

13:43:18 §e[NPC] §aWeaponsmith§f: §r§fHey! I am looking to make some Hot Potato Books to enhance some of my weapons, do you have any potatoes to spare?
13:43:21 §e[NPC] §aWeaponsmith§f: §r§fToo bad, I guess I'll have to look for actual metal next time...
13:43:22 §e[NPC] §9Zog§f: §r§fI have a big problem. I lost my sense of taste, now I can't tell the difference between a melon and a cactus...

18:49:29 §e[NPC] §aMason§f: §r§fI paid for one of Treasure Hunter's tips today and again, it only led me to a dirty shoelace. His tips are just not worth it...

18:49:32 §e[NPC] §aJack§f: §r§fDid you know that you gain additional §6☘ Farming Fortune §fwhile on the §bGarden§f? You can check it in your SkyBlock Profile!
