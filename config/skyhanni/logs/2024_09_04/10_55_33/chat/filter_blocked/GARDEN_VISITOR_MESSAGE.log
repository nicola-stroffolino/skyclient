11:07:32 §e[NPC] §aFear Mongerer§f: §r§fMortal, the time of reckoning is near. The Past will light the future.
11:07:35 §e[NPC] §aDuke§f: §rYou seem new here. You should probably try to get some §aEnchanted Cactus Green §ffor me.
11:07:38 §e[NPC] §aTom§f: §r§fI don't have a recipe for you, however I'd happily take some crops.
11:07:40 §e[NPC] §aLynn§f: §r§fIf you ever get lost, you should check on the Desk on what to do next.
11:07:43 §e[NPC] §aJack§f: §r§fDid you know that you gain additional §6☘ Farming Fortune §fwhile on the §bGarden§f? You can check it in your SkyBlock Profile!
11:09:12 §e[NPC] §aDuke§f: §r§fSee ya next time!
11:09:15 §e[NPC] §aFear Mongerer§f: §r§fMay your destiny be ridded with fortune.
11:09:18 §e[NPC] §aTom§f: §r§fI'll be sure to come by next time.
11:09:20 §e[NPC] §aLynn§f: §r§fHave a good one.
11:09:22 §e[NPC] §aJack§f: §r§fThanks for the crops. See ya around.
11:11:00 §e[NPC] §aLumber Jack§f: §r§fMy assistant is feeling off, and I think we could do with a hearty meal. Do you think you can help us out?
11:11:34 §e[NPC] §aLumber Jack§f: §r§fThank you! I'm sure this will make him feel better.
13:04:56 §e[NPC] §9Lazy Miner§f: §rIt's Wednesday, my resting day! I earned myself a little treat, maybe you could bring me some chocolate?
13:04:59 §e[NPC] §aAdventurer§f: §r§fExploring the whole wide world makes me hungry, I could take some fresh potatoes.
13:05:03 §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fI don't really have a sweet tooth, but chocolate is probably my favorite thing in this world. But the supply is really poor mostly because of the mines' lack of accessibility.
13:05:12 §e[NPC] §aOdawa§f: §r§fI'm supposed to collect some food for the village, the Kalhuiki people have been through a tough time recently.
13:05:15 §e[NPC] §aLumber Jack§f: §r§fMy assistant is feeling off, and I think we could do with a hearty meal. Do you think you can help us out?
13:06:47 §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fAmazing! I haven't eaten such chocolatey goodness in a long time...Maybe they should invest in that rusty old lift.
13:06:58 §e[NPC] §aOdawa§f: §r§fPerfect! I'll share the good news with my village!
13:07:00 §e[NPC] §aLumber Jack§f: §r§fThank you! I'm sure this will make him feel better.
13:07:01 §e[NPC] §aAdventurer§f: §r§fThanks man, that should be enough food for my travels.
13:07:03 §e[NPC] §9Lazy Miner§f: §r§fMmh! This is really good! I'll be sure to come back again when I'm no longer busy!
13:23:46 §e[NPC] §6Clerk Seraphine§f: §r§fHey §aHotBaconWasTaken§f, the mayor elections are coming up and I've ran out of ballot paper! Could you help me out?
13:23:53 §e[NPC] §9Bartender§f: §r§fI want to make some new brews, do you think you can give me some ingredients to work with?
13:24:23 §e[NPC] §6Clerk Seraphine§f: §r§fThank you very much! I'll make sure to give these extra ballots to only the elites!
13:24:25 §e[NPC] §9Bartender§f: §r§fMany Thanks! I'll be sure to let you have the first taste as soon as it's done... at a discounted price of course.
13:35:54 §e[NPC] §aPlumber Joe§f: §r§fI once dumped a magical water bucket into the toilet. It won't stop overflowing. Anyway, you got something for me?
13:35:58 §e[NPC] §aPlumber Joe§f: §r§fI guess I'll just try to fix it myself.
14:40:05 §e[NPC] §aWizard§f: §rWhere am I? Oh, it's you §aHotBaconWasTaken§f.
14:40:12 §e[NPC] §aWizard§f: §r§fI suppose that was expected. Not many people have enough potatoes to power a magical portal.
14:40:13 §e[NPC] §aOdawa§f: §r§fI'm supposed to collect some food for the village, the Kalhuiki people have been through a tough time recently.
14:40:36 §e[NPC] §aOdawa§f: §r§fPerfect! I'll share the good news with my village!
14:40:39 §e[NPC] §9Gold Forger§f: §r§fDo Golden Carrots taste different than normal ones? I've actually never tried one before so I am pretty curious how they taste.
14:40:59 §e[NPC] §9Gold Forger§f: §r§fLet's taste...THIS IS DISGUSTING!!! Why would anyone waste such precious gold on this? Just like any other fancy food, expensive and gross...
14:41:00 §e[NPC] §aShaggy§f: §r§fHey kid, I haven't seen you in a while. Arachne's powers are growing day by day. Soon she'll take over the §cSpider's Den§f.
14:41:05 §e[NPC] §aShaggy§f: §r§fI wish peace upon you.
14:41:06 §e[NPC] §aHungry Hiker§f: §r§fHello there, I seem to be stuck here with no good food to eat, could you bring me some square orange fruits?
14:41:11 §e[NPC] §aHungry Hiker§f: §r§fI guess I'll just go hungry then...
14:58:07 §e[NPC] §aEmissary Fraiser§f: §r§fI know what all the others say, but I am the King's true favorite emissary.
14:58:10 §e[NPC] §6Jerry§f: §rHello §aHotBaconWasTaken§f. Glad to meet you here. I need some §9Mutant Nether Wart§f.
14:58:24 §e[NPC] §6Jerry§f: §r§fThis is not my realm. I must return. Thank you.
14:58:28 §e[NPC] §aEmissary Fraiser§f: §r§fThe King will surely punish you for this disrespect!
15:07:23 §e[NPC] §9Lazy Miner§f: §rIt's Tuesday, my resting day! I earned myself a little treat, maybe you could bring me some chocolate?
15:07:40 §e[NPC] §9Lazy Miner§f: §r§fMmh! This is really good! I'll be sure to come back again when I'm no longer busy!
17:30:38 §e[NPC] §aRhys§f: §r§fI found an unexplored cave while mining for titanium. But it's too dark to see in there, even for me! Can you spare any glowing pumpkins?
17:30:41 §e[NPC] §aRhys§f: §r§fWell then, I will even mine in total darkness if I must!
17:30:42 §e[NPC] §aAndrew§f: §rDid you know that SkyBlock has been running for §b4453 §fin-game months already? Time flies.
17:30:46 §e[NPC] §aAndrew§f: §r§fI guess I'll come back in a bit.
17:30:47 §e[NPC] §aFear Mongerer§f: §r§fMortal, the time of reckoning is near. The Past will light the future.
17:30:54 §e[NPC] §aFear Mongerer§f: §r§fSoon.
17:30:54 §e[NPC] §aFelix§f: §r§fYou won't be able to store any items in the Garden, you should keep them on your Private Island!
17:30:57 §e[NPC] §aFelix§f: §r§fMaybe next time.
17:30:58 §e[NPC] §aWizard§f: §rWhere am I? Oh, it's you §aHotBaconWasTaken§f.
17:31:01 §e[NPC] §aWizard§f: §r§fI suppose that was expected. Not many people have enough potatoes to power a magical portal.
20:21:06 §e[NPC] §aJotraeline Greatforge§f: §r§fI heard you have a composter in your barn, it happens to run on the same fuel drills run on! Could I check it out?
20:21:14 §e[NPC] §aPlumber Joe§f: §r§fI once dumped a magical water bucket into the toilet. It won't stop overflowing. Anyway, you got something for me?
20:21:21 §e[NPC] §aEmissary Fraiser§f: §r§fI know what all the others say, but I am the King's true favorite emissary.
20:21:23 §e[NPC] §9Grandma Wolf§f: §r§fMy little child, you don't look so good. You should eat something. I have an idea, give me some ingredients and I'll make you a nice soup.
20:21:25 §e[NPC] §aRyu§f: §r§fDid you know that there is a Garden Level? Increase it by hitting milestones or selling to customers like me!
20:21:47 §e[NPC] §aJotraeline Greatforge§f: §r§fQuite fascinating technology you have there, I'm sure with this machinery we could create even better appliances in the future!
20:24:37 §e[NPC] §aRyu§f: §r§fThat's alright.
20:24:40 §e[NPC] §9Grandma Wolf§f: §r§fYou denied Grandma Wolf's request. How dare you treat your granny like that.
20:24:41 §e[NPC] §aEmissary Fraiser§f: §r§fThe King will surely punish you for this disrespect!
20:24:43 §e[NPC] §aPlumber Joe§f: §r§fI guess I'll just try to fix it myself.
21:13:16 §e[NPC] §9Lumina§f: §r§fI'm looking to make some Jack o' Lanterns to help light up the Crystal Hollows - maybe you can help me out?
21:13:19 §e[NPC] §aLumber Jack§f: §r§fMy assistant is feeling off, and I think we could do with a hearty meal. Do you think you can help us out?
21:13:22 §e[NPC] §aTrevor§f: §r§fI've been tracking an animal for the past few days. Got anything I could use as bait?
21:13:30 §e[NPC] §aVex§f: §r§fI have an offer for you that you can't refuse.
21:13:33 §e[NPC] §aFarmhand§f: §r§fI took a break from work for too long! Now I need your help to meet my quota!
21:13:38 §e[NPC] §aFarmhand§f: §r§fYou condemn me to doing my own work? How can you do this to me!
21:13:40 §e[NPC] §aVex§f: §r§fOh well that's awkward.
21:13:42 §e[NPC] §aTrevor§f: §r§fLooks like I'll have to catch it the old fashioned way.
21:13:43 §e[NPC] §aLumber Jack§f: §r§fI thought you'd be more thankful for the sweet axe my assistant gave you.
21:14:12 §e[NPC] §9Lumina§f: §r§fNice doin' business with ya! Here's some copper in return.
