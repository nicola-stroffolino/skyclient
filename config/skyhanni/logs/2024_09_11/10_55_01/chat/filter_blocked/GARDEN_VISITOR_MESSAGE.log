11:02:14 §e[NPC] §aDusk§f: §r§fDusk needs some watermelon to quench his thirst. Dusk would appreciate it.
11:03:02 §e[NPC] §aDusk§f: §r§fDusk thanks you. Dusk will make sure to visit your farm again.
11:03:06 §e[NPC] §aTerry§f: §r§fAhoy, §aHotBaconWasTaken§f! People always tell me they like ice cream, but ice never really tastes like anything for me!
11:03:13 §e[NPC] §aTerry§f: §r§fI'll keep crunching on those ice cubes, maybe I am missing something.
11:03:14 §e[NPC] §aVex§f: §r§fI have an offer for you that you can't refuse.
11:03:16 §e[NPC] §aVex§f: §r§fOh well that's awkward.
11:03:17 §e[NPC] §aOdawa§f: §r§fI'm supposed to collect some food for the village, the Kalhuiki people have been through a tough time recently.
11:03:21 §e[NPC] §aOdawa§f: §r§fI guess I'll have to turn up empty-handed.
11:03:22 §e[NPC] §aStella§f: §r§fThe amount of plots you can unlock here is perfect for a Co-op. So much space!
11:03:24 §e[NPC] §aStella§f: §r§fDon't worry, I'll come back later.
16:05:26 §e[NPC] §aGuy§f: §r§fHeard you may got some mushrooms...I've been looking for some...
16:05:29 §e[NPC] §aGuy§f: §r§fOh man gee, that's awful man, call me when you got 'em alright?
16:05:30 §e[NPC] §9Seymour§f: §r§fWanting to buy something from me? I got some pretty fancy tuxedos for sale, for a price of a small fortune.
16:05:32 §e[NPC] §9Seymour§f: §r§f*sigh* You're missing out on some awfully fancy gear.
16:05:34 §e[NPC] §aJamie§f: §r§fYou might have noticed that you can purchase additional plots within your Desk in the Barn!
16:05:35 §e[NPC] §aJamie§f: §r§fNo worries.
16:05:36 §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fI don't really have a sweet tooth, but chocolate is probably my favorite thing in this world. But the supply is really poor mostly because of the mines' lack of accessibility.
16:05:38 §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fI helped you enter the Crystal Hollows so many times! Why won't you return the favor?
16:05:39 §e[NPC] §9Iron Forger§f: §r§fI've recently got into cooking, yesterday I made pasta carbonara, today I'm planning on baking a carrot cake.
16:05:41 §e[NPC] §9Iron Forger§f: §r§fWill have to order some food today then.
22:43:20 §e[NPC] §9Bartender§f: §r§fI want to make some new brews, do you think you can give me some ingredients to work with?
22:43:25 §e[NPC] §aOdawa§f: §r§fI'm supposed to collect some food for the village, the Kalhuiki people have been through a tough time recently.
22:43:28 §e[NPC] §6Clerk Seraphine§f: §r§fHey §aHotBaconWasTaken§f, the mayor elections are coming up and I've ran out of ballot paper! Could you help me out?
22:43:30 §e[NPC] §aOringo§f: §r§fHey, you got some wheat for my pets by any chance? Gotta keep those little monsters fed, haha!
22:43:33 §e[NPC] §aFarmhand§f: §r§fI took a break from work for too long! Now I need your help to meet my quota!
22:44:31 §e[NPC] §6Clerk Seraphine§f: §r§fThank you very much! I'll make sure to give these extra ballots to only the elites!
22:44:41 §e[NPC] §aFarmhand§f: §r§fYou condemn me to doing my own work? How can you do this to me!
22:44:43 §e[NPC] §aOringo§f: §r§fOh, you're out of wheat? Alright, I'll come back later then.
22:44:44 §e[NPC] §aOdawa§f: §r§fI guess I'll have to turn up empty-handed.
22:44:47 §e[NPC] §9Bartender§f: §r§fHard times we are in. Take care!
22:53:57 §e[NPC] §9Lumina§f: §r§fI'm looking to make some Jack o' Lanterns to help light up the Crystal Hollows - maybe you can help me out?
22:54:05 §e[NPC] §9Lumina§f: §r§fNot a problem, thanks for your time anyways.
