20:36:11 §e[NPC] §aFisherman§f: §r§fA Carrot King has been scaring off all the good fish, I need to deal with it before I lose more fish.
20:36:17 §e[NPC] §aFisherman§f: §r§fS'alright, we are all busy some days.
20:36:18 §e[NPC] §9Tia the Fairy§f: §rYou are currently missing §d12 §fFairy Souls. Better get to work!
20:36:22 §e[NPC] §9Tia the Fairy§f: §r§fAlright, I won't bother you anymore.
20:36:22 §e[NPC] §9Seymour§f: §r§fWanting to buy something from me? I got some pretty fancy tuxedos for sale, for a price of a small fortune.
20:36:28 §e[NPC] §aFear Mongerer§f: §r§fMortal, the time of reckoning is near. The Past will light the future.
20:36:32 §e[NPC] §aFear Mongerer§f: §r§fSoon.
20:36:33 §e[NPC] §aVex§f: §r§fI have an offer for you that you can't refuse.
20:36:37 §e[NPC] §aVex§f: §r§fOh well that's awkward.
20:36:39 §e[NPC] §9Seymour§f: §r§f*sigh* You're missing out on some awfully fancy gear.
21:03:24 §e[NPC] §aEmissary Ceanna§f: §r§fThe King's favorite emissary is here to request potatoes for the King's great feast! 
21:03:29 §e[NPC] §aEmissary Ceanna§f: §r§fI will inform the King about this disgrace!
21:03:29 §e[NPC] §9Iron Forger§f: §r§fI've recently got into cooking, yesterday I made pasta carbonara, today I'm planning on baking a carrot cake.
21:03:34 §e[NPC] §9Iron Forger§f: §r§fWill have to order some food today then.
21:03:34 §e[NPC] §9Puzzler§f: §r§f§d▲§2▼§ftriangle§2▼§d▶§5▲§ffood§3◀§5▲
21:03:38 §e[NPC] §9Puzzler§f: §r§f§c╳ §f(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
21:09:15 §e[NPC] §9Bartender§f: §r§fI want to make some new brews, do you think you can give me some ingredients to work with?
21:44:41 §e[NPC] §aHungry Hiker§f: §r§fHello there, I seem to be stuck here with no good food to eat, could you bring me some square orange fruits?
21:44:58 §e[NPC] §aHungry Hiker§f: §r§fI guess I'll just go hungry then...
21:44:59 §e[NPC] §aMason§f: §r§fI paid for one of Treasure Hunter's tips today and again, it only led me to a dirty shoelace. His tips are just not worth it...
21:45:05 §e[NPC] §aMason§f: §r§fYou're no better than the Treasure Hunter...
21:45:06 §e[NPC] §9Vinyl Collector§f: §r§fHey man, I just need one more vinyl to complete the full Pest Vinyl collection.
21:45:44 §e[NPC] §9Vinyl Collector§f: §r§fFinally! Thanks man, now I have another complete set!
21:45:45 §e[NPC] §aLeo§f: §r§fSadly you can't gather logs in the §bGarden§f, however there are plenty of crops here!
21:46:03 §e[NPC] §9Bartender§f: §r§fHard times we are in. Take care!
21:46:04 §e[NPC] §aLeo§f: §r§fHmm, too bad.
22:07:10 §e[NPC] §aAdventurer§f: §r§fExploring the whole wide world makes me hungry, I could take some fresh potatoes.
22:09:49 §e[NPC] §aAdventurer§f: §r§fExploring the whole wide world makes me hungry, I could take some fresh potatoes.
22:09:53 §e[NPC] §aAdventurer§f: §r§fDarn it, I'll have to find another farmer then.
22:12:16 §e[NPC] §aAlchemist§f: §r§fBeen running low on my brewing supplies, Nether Warts are quite hard to come by these days.
22:12:21 §e[NPC] §aAlchemist§f: §r§fUnfortunate, I'll see if I can find some Nether Warts from someone else.
22:47:42 §e[NPC] §9Old Man Garry§f: §r§fPeople have no manners these days. They come up to me, and disappear instantly! They don't even greet me! Back in my day, we were raised better than that.
22:47:45 §e[NPC] §9Old Man Garry§f: §r§fOf course. What else did I expect from this generation.
22:47:46 §e[NPC] §aLumber Jack§f: §r§fMy assistant is feeling off, and I think we could do with a hearty meal. Do you think you can help us out?
22:47:50 §e[NPC] §aLumber Jack§f: §r§fI thought you'd be more thankful for the sweet axe my assistant gave you.
22:47:50 §e[NPC] §aStella§f: §r§fThe amount of plots you can unlock here is perfect for a Co-op. So much space!
22:47:54 §e[NPC] §aStella§f: §r§fDon't worry, I'll come back later.
23:15:14 §e[NPC] §aWizard§f: §rWhere am I? Oh, it's you §aHotBaconWasTaken§f.
23:15:16 §e[NPC] §aWizard§f: §r§fI suppose that was expected. Not many people have enough potatoes to power a magical portal.
23:15:17 §e[NPC] §aLibrarian§f: §r§fGreetings! I've been running low on paper recently for my Enchanted Books, could you bring me some Sugar Cane?
23:15:21 §e[NPC] §aLibrarian§f: §r§fVery unfortunate, I really needed that paper...
23:15:23 §e[NPC] §aFisherman§f: §r§fA Carrot King has been scaring off all the good fish, I need to deal with it before I lose more fish.
23:15:26 §e[NPC] §aFisherman§f: §r§fS'alright, we are all busy some days.
23:15:27 §e[NPC] §aJacob§f: §r§fHowdy! Fine barn ye got there eh? Good lad, you think ye could get me some wheat, eh?

23:15:32 §e[NPC] §9Grandma Wolf§f: §r§fMy little child, you don't look so good. You should eat something. I have an idea, give me some ingredients and I'll make you a nice soup.
23:15:36 §e[NPC] §9Grandma Wolf§f: §r§fYou denied Grandma Wolf's request. How dare you treat your granny like that.
23:15:37 §e[NPC] §aTerry§f: §r§fAhoy, §aHotBaconWasTaken§f! People always tell me they like ice cream, but ice never really tastes like anything for me!
23:15:40 §e[NPC] §aTerry§f: §r§fYou are saying I need to combine these items with ice to have a taste? I'll believe it when I see it!
23:25:48 §e[NPC] §aGeonathan Greatforge§f: §r§fI usually only work with Oil Barrels, but I'd like to try making some Biofuel from compost.
23:26:01 §e[NPC] §aGeonathan Greatforge§f: §r§fOil Barrels are far superior, but at least this is 100% renewable. Pretty neat!
