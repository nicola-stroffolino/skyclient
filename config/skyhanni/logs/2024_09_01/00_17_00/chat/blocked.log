00:27:40 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §9Lazy Miner§f: §rIt's Monday, my resting day! I earned myself a little treat, maybe you could bring me some chocolate?
00:27:42 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fI don't really have a sweet tooth, but chocolate is probably my favorite thing in this world. But the supply is really poor mostly because of the mines' lack of accessibility.
00:27:43 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §aFear Mongerer§f: §r§fMortal, the time of reckoning is near. The Past will light the future.
00:27:45 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §9Emissary Sisko§f: §r§fI've heard I can find the best mushrooms here, and as the King's favorite emissary I will bring them to him!
00:27:46 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §aTrevor§f: §r§fI've been tracking an animal for the past few days. Got anything I could use as bait?
00:28:21 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §9Lazy Miner§f: §r§fMmh! This is really good! I'll be sure to come back again when I'm no longer busy!
00:28:23 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fAmazing! I haven't eaten such chocolatey goodness in a long time...Maybe they should invest in that rusty old lift.
00:28:36 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §9Emissary Sisko§f: §r§fYou are going to regret this!
00:28:42 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §aFear Mongerer§f: §r§fSoon.
00:29:01 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §aTrevor§f: §r§fThis should do nicely. I'll have plenty of pelts by the end of the day.
