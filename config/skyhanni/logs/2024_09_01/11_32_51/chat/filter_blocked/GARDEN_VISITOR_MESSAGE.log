11:55:31 §e[NPC] §aAdventurer§f: §r§fExploring the whole wide world makes me hungry, I could take some fresh potatoes.

11:55:41 §e[NPC] §aPlumber Joe§f: §r§fI once dumped a magical water bucket into the toilet. It won't stop overflowing. Anyway, you got something for me?

13:21:20 §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fI don't really have a sweet tooth, but chocolate is probably my favorite thing in this world. But the supply is really poor mostly because of the mines' lack of accessibility.

13:21:26 §e[NPC] §9Grandma Wolf§f: §r§fMy little child, you don't look so good. You should eat something. I have an idea, give me some ingredients and I'll make you a nice soup.
13:21:31 §e[NPC] §9Grandma Wolf§f: §r§fYou denied Grandma Wolf's request. How dare you treat your granny like that.

13:58:27 §e[NPC] §9Emissary Sisko§f: §r§fI've heard I can find the best mushrooms here, and as the King's favorite emissary I will bring them to him!
