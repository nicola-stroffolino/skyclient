10:04:46 §e[NPC] §6Jerry§f: §rHello §aHotBaconWasTaken§f. Glad to meet you here. I need some §aEnchanted Hay Bale§f.
10:04:54 §e[NPC] §aWizard§f: §rWhere am I? Oh, it's you §aHotBaconWasTaken§f.
10:05:08 §e[NPC] §6Jerry§f: §r§fThis is not my realm. I must return. Thank you.
10:05:10 §e[NPC] §9Emissary Sisko§f: §r§fI've heard I can find the best mushrooms here, and as the King's favorite emissary I will bring them to him!
10:05:17 §e[NPC] §9Emissary Sisko§f: §r§fYou are going to regret this!
10:05:19 §e[NPC] §9Seymour§f: §r§fWanting to buy something from me? I got some pretty fancy tuxedos for sale, for a price of a small fortune.
10:05:27 §e[NPC] §9Seymour§f: §r§f*sigh* You're missing out on some awfully fancy gear.
10:05:27 §e[NPC] §aJotraeline Greatforge§f: §r§fI heard you have a composter in your barn, it happens to run on the same fuel drills run on! Could I check it out?
10:05:39 §e[NPC] §aWizard§f: §r§fI suppose that was expected. Not many people have enough potatoes to power a magical portal.
10:06:19 §e[NPC] §aJotraeline Greatforge§f: §r§fQuite fascinating technology you have there, I'm sure with this machinery we could create even better appliances in the future!
14:20:29 §e[NPC] §aJacob§f: §r§fHowdy! Fine barn ye got there eh? Good lad, you think ye could get me some wheat, eh?
14:20:34 §e[NPC] §aLeo§f: §r§fSadly you can't gather logs in the §bGarden§f, however there are plenty of crops here!
14:20:37 §e[NPC] §aLeo§f: §r§fHmm, too bad.
14:20:39 §e[NPC] §aJacob§f: §r§fGosh darn it matey, can't believe ya do me like that, eh?
14:20:40 §e[NPC] §aFisherman§f: §r§fA Carrot King has been scaring off all the good fish, I need to deal with it before I lose more fish.
14:20:43 §e[NPC] §aFisherman§f: §r§fS'alright, we are all busy some days.
14:20:44 §e[NPC] §aHungry Hiker§f: §r§fHello there, I seem to be stuck here with no good food to eat, could you bring me some square orange fruits?
14:20:45 §e[NPC] §aHungry Hiker§f: §r§fI guess I'll just go hungry then...
14:20:46 §e[NPC] §aOdawa§f: §r§fI'm supposed to collect some food for the village, the Kalhuiki people have been through a tough time recently.
14:20:49 §e[NPC] §aOdawa§f: §r§fI guess I'll have to turn up empty-handed.
17:16:02 §e[NPC] §9Tia the Fairy§f: §rYou are currently missing §d10 §fFairy Souls. Better get to work!
17:16:08 §e[NPC] §6Madame Eleanor Q. Goldsworth III§f: §r§fI'm here to put a value on your farm. Bring me your fanciest crop.
17:16:28 §e[NPC] §aFear Mongerer§f: §r§fMortal, the time of reckoning is near. The Past will light the future.
17:17:02 §e[NPC] §aFear Mongerer§f: §r§fSoon.
17:17:03 §e[NPC] §9Rusty§f: §rEver wondered how I find all the things that other players lost? I outsource it. Right now, someone is looking for their §aEnchanted Pumpkin§f. Can you find that for me?
17:17:22 §e[NPC] §9Rusty§f: §r§fTurns out, if you want something done, you have to do it yourself.
17:17:23 §e[NPC] §aFriendly Hiker§f: §r§fI'm planning to head back into the gorge to fetch my hiker friend, but I'll need some meat to cook before I head in there.
17:17:28 §e[NPC] §aFriendly Hiker§f: §r§fThat's alright. I can always head into the Oasis to hunt down some sheep.
17:17:33 §e[NPC] §9Tia the Fairy§f: §r§fAlright, I won't bother you anymore.
17:17:46 §e[NPC] §6Madame Eleanor Q. Goldsworth III§f: §rTruly Magnificent! I value your farm at a minimum of §6120,000,100 §fcoins!
17:25:20 §e[NPC] §aFriendly Hiker§f: §r§fI'm planning to head back into the gorge to fetch my hiker friend, but I'll need some meat to cook before I head in there.
17:25:22 §e[NPC] §aFriendly Hiker§f: §r§fThat's alright. I can always head into the Oasis to hunt down some sheep.
18:43:42 §e[NPC] §aLumber Jack§f: §r§fMy assistant is feeling off, and I think we could do with a hearty meal. Do you think you can help us out?
18:43:46 §e[NPC] §aLumber Jack§f: §r§fI thought you'd be more thankful for the sweet axe my assistant gave you.
18:43:47 §e[NPC] §aGuy§f: §r§fHeard you may got some mushrooms...I've been looking for some...
18:43:49 §e[NPC] §aGuy§f: §r§fOh man gee, that's awful man, call me when you got 'em alright?
18:43:50 §e[NPC] §aGeonathan Greatforge§f: §r§fI usually only work with Oil Barrels, but I'd like to try making some Biofuel from compost.
18:43:54 §e[NPC] §aGeonathan Greatforge§f: §r§fNot a problem. I hear that Biofuel is worse anyways.
18:43:54 §e[NPC] §aAlchemist§f: §r§fBeen running low on my brewing supplies, Nether Warts are quite hard to come by these days.
18:43:56 §e[NPC] §aAlchemist§f: §r§fUnfortunate, I'll see if I can find some Nether Warts from someone else.
18:43:56 §e[NPC] §aVex§f: §r§fI have an offer for you that you can't refuse.
18:43:58 §e[NPC] §aVex§f: §r§fOh well that's awkward.
20:56:07 §e[NPC] §9Tammy§f: §r§fI've been planning to build a trap for unaware animals so I can hunt them more efficiently. I really need some cactus, preferably the ones with the biggest spikes!
20:56:10 §e[NPC] §9Tammy§f: §r§fYou can't tell me that you couldn't find a single cactus...
20:56:10 §e[NPC] §aJotraeline Greatforge§f: §r§fI heard you have a composter in your barn, it happens to run on the same fuel drills run on! Could I check it out?
20:56:13 §e[NPC] §aJotraeline Greatforge§f: §r§fThat's alright! I'll just save up 12 years to be able to afford one myself.
20:56:13 §e[NPC] §aDuke§f: §rYou seem new here. You should probably try to get some §9Enchanted Sugar Cane §ffor me.
20:56:16 §e[NPC] §aDuke§f: §r§fMaybe next time.
20:56:16 §e[NPC] §aLumber Jack§f: §r§fMy assistant is feeling off, and I think we could do with a hearty meal. Do you think you can help us out?
20:56:18 §e[NPC] §aLumber Jack§f: §r§fI thought you'd be more thankful for the sweet axe my assistant gave you.
20:56:18 §e[NPC] §aTrevor§f: §r§fI've been tracking an animal for the past few days. Got anything I could use as bait?
20:56:21 §e[NPC] §aTrevor§f: §r§fLooks like I'll have to catch it the old fashioned way.
21:08:11 §e[NPC] §aTerry§f: §r§fAhoy, §aHotBaconWasTaken§f! People always tell me they like ice cream, but ice never really tastes like anything for me!
21:08:14 §e[NPC] §aTerry§f: §r§fI'll keep crunching on those ice cubes, maybe I am missing something.
