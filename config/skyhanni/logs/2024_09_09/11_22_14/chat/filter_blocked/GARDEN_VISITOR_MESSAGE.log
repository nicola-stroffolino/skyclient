15:21:33 §e[NPC] §aWizard§f: §rWhere am I? Oh, it's you §aHotBaconWasTaken§f.
15:21:34 §e[NPC] §aWizard§f: §r§fI suppose that was expected. Not many people have enough potatoes to power a magical portal.
15:21:35 §e[NPC] §aFisherman§f: §r§fA Carrot King has been scaring off all the good fish, I need to deal with it before I lose more fish.
15:21:37 §e[NPC] §aFisherman§f: §r§fS'alright, we are all busy some days.
15:21:38 §e[NPC] §aStella§f: §r§fThe amount of plots you can unlock here is perfect for a Co-op. So much space!
15:21:39 §e[NPC] §aStella§f: §r§fDon't worry, I'll come back later.
15:21:40 §e[NPC] §aLynn§f: §r§fIf you ever get lost, you should check on the Desk on what to do next.
15:21:42 §e[NPC] §aLynn§f: §r§fMaybe next time.
15:21:42 §e[NPC] §aFarmhand§f: §r§fI took a break from work for too long! Now I need your help to meet my quota!
15:21:44 §e[NPC] §aFarmhand§f: §r§fYou condemn me to doing my own work? How can you do this to me!
19:24:26 §e[NPC] §aEmissary Fraiser§f: §r§fI know what all the others say, but I am the King's true favorite emissary.
19:24:30 §e[NPC] §aEmissary Fraiser§f: §r§fThe King will surely punish you for this disrespect!
19:24:31 §e[NPC] §aAdventurer§f: §r§fExploring the whole wide world makes me hungry, I could take some fresh potatoes.
19:24:32 §e[NPC] §aAdventurer§f: §r§fDarn it, I'll have to find another farmer then.
19:24:33 §e[NPC] §9Grandma Wolf§f: §r§fMy little child, you don't look so good. You should eat something. I have an idea, give me some ingredients and I'll make you a nice soup.
19:24:35 §e[NPC] §9Grandma Wolf§f: §r§fYou denied Grandma Wolf's request. How dare you treat your granny like that.
19:24:36 §e[NPC] §aFelix§f: §r§fYou won't be able to store any items in the Garden, you should keep them on your Private Island!
19:24:38 §e[NPC] §aFelix§f: §r§fMaybe next time.
19:24:38 §e[NPC] §9Tia the Fairy§f: §rYou are currently missing §d10 §fFairy Souls. Better get to work!
19:24:42 §e[NPC] §9Tia the Fairy§f: §r§fAlright, I won't bother you anymore.
00:01:02 §e[NPC] §aStella§f: §r§fThe amount of plots you can unlock here is perfect for a Co-op. So much space!
00:01:03 §e[NPC] §aStella§f: §r§fDon't worry, I'll come back later.
00:01:04 §e[NPC] §aRhys§f: §r§fI found an unexplored cave while mining for titanium. But it's too dark to see in there, even for me! Can you spare any glowing pumpkins?
00:01:05 §e[NPC] §aRhys§f: §r§fWell then, I will even mine in total darkness if I must!
00:01:06 §e[NPC] §aHungry Hiker§f: §r§fHello there, I seem to be stuck here with no good food to eat, could you bring me some square orange fruits?
00:01:07 §e[NPC] §aHungry Hiker§f: §r§fI guess I'll just go hungry then...
00:01:08 §e[NPC] §aEmissary Ceanna§f: §r§fThe King's favorite emissary is here to request potatoes for the King's great feast! 
00:01:14 §e[NPC] §aEmissary Ceanna§f: §r§fI will inform the King about this disgrace!
00:01:15 §e[NPC] §aLumber Jack§f: §r§fMy assistant is feeling off, and I think we could do with a hearty meal. Do you think you can help us out?
00:01:44 §e[NPC] §aLumber Jack§f: §r§fI thought you'd be more thankful for the sweet axe my assistant gave you.
00:09:30 §e[NPC] §9Zog§f: §r§fI have a big problem. I lost my sense of taste, now I can't tell the difference between a melon and a cactus...
00:09:33 §e[NPC] §9Zog§f: §r§fMy tongue is hurting for some reason...
