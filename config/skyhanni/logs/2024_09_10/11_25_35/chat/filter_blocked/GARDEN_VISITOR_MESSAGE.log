12:11:33 §e[NPC] §9Zog§f: §r§fI have a big problem. I lost my sense of taste, now I can't tell the difference between a melon and a cactus...
12:11:38 §e[NPC] §9Zog§f: §r§fMy tongue is hurting for some reason...
12:11:39 §e[NPC] §aMason§f: §r§fI paid for one of Treasure Hunter's tips today and again, it only led me to a dirty shoelace. His tips are just not worth it...
12:11:41 §e[NPC] §aMason§f: §r§fYou're no better than the Treasure Hunter...
12:11:42 §e[NPC] §aAlchemist§f: §r§fBeen running low on my brewing supplies, Nether Warts are quite hard to come by these days.
12:11:47 §e[NPC] §aAlchemist§f: §r§fUnfortunate, I'll see if I can find some Nether Warts from someone else.
12:11:47 §e[NPC] §aWeaponsmith§f: §r§fHey! I am looking to make some Hot Potato Books to enhance some of my weapons, do you have any potatoes to spare?
12:11:49 §e[NPC] §aWeaponsmith§f: §r§fToo bad, I guess I'll have to look for actual metal next time...
12:11:50 §e[NPC] §aWizard§f: §rWhere am I? Oh, it's you §aHotBaconWasTaken§f.
12:11:51 §e[NPC] §aWizard§f: §r§fI suppose that was expected. Not many people have enough potatoes to power a magical portal.
12:17:33 §e[NPC] §aLynn§f: §r§fIf you ever get lost, you should check on the Desk on what to do next.
12:17:35 §e[NPC] §aLynn§f: §r§fMaybe next time.
12:45:49 §e[NPC] §aLibrarian§f: §r§fGreetings! I've been running low on paper recently for my Enchanted Books, could you bring me some Sugar Cane?
12:45:52 §e[NPC] §aLibrarian§f: §r§fVery unfortunate, I really needed that paper...
12:45:53 §e[NPC] §9Seymour§f: §r§fWanting to buy something from me? I got some pretty fancy tuxedos for sale, for a price of a small fortune.
