00:19:07 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §9Tammy§f: §r§fYou can't tell me that you couldn't find a single cactus...
00:19:08 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §aWeaponsmith§f: §r§fHey! I am looking to make some Hot Potato Books to enhance some of my weapons, do you have any potatoes to spare?
00:19:09 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §aWeaponsmith§f: §r§fToo bad, I guess I'll have to look for actual metal next time...

00:32:36 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fI helped you enter the Crystal Hollows so many times! Why won't you return the favor?
