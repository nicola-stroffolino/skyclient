11:53:08 §e[NPC] §aLumber Jack§f: §r§fMy assistant is feeling off, and I think we could do with a hearty meal. Do you think you can help us out?
11:53:16 §e[NPC] §aLumber Jack§f: §r§fI thought you'd be more thankful for the sweet axe my assistant gave you.
11:53:17 §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fI don't really have a sweet tooth, but chocolate is probably my favorite thing in this world. But the supply is really poor mostly because of the mines' lack of accessibility.
11:53:19 §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fI helped you enter the Crystal Hollows so many times! Why won't you return the favor?
11:53:20 §e[NPC] §aJacob§f: §r§fHowdy! Fine barn ye got there eh? Good lad, you think ye could get me some wheat, eh?

11:53:24 §e[NPC] §aFarmhand§f: §r§fI took a break from work for too long! Now I need your help to meet my quota!
11:53:26 §e[NPC] §aFarmhand§f: §r§fYou condemn me to doing my own work? How can you do this to me!
12:16:55 §e[NPC] §aTerry§f: §r§fAhoy, §aHotBaconWasTaken§f! People always tell me they like ice cream, but ice never really tastes like anything for me!
12:16:57 §e[NPC] §aTerry§f: §r§fI'll keep crunching on those ice cubes, maybe I am missing something.
12:16:57 §e[NPC] §aFear Mongerer§f: §r§fMortal, the time of reckoning is near. The Past will light the future.
12:16:59 §e[NPC] §aFear Mongerer§f: §r§fSoon.
14:54:05 §e[NPC] §9Old Man Garry§f: §r§fPeople have no manners these days. They come up to me, and disappear instantly! They don't even greet me! Back in my day, we were raised better than that.
14:54:08 §e[NPC] §9Old Man Garry§f: §r§fOf course. What else did I expect from this generation.
14:54:09 §e[NPC] §9Iron Forger§f: §r§fI've recently got into cooking, yesterday I made pasta carbonara, today I'm planning on baking a carrot cake.
14:54:14 §e[NPC] §9Iron Forger§f: §r§fWill have to order some food today then.
14:54:15 §e[NPC] §aGeonathan Greatforge§f: §r§fI usually only work with Oil Barrels, but I'd like to try making some Biofuel from compost.
14:54:17 §e[NPC] §aGeonathan Greatforge§f: §r§fNot a problem. I hear that Biofuel is worse anyways.
14:54:18 §e[NPC] §aFisherman§f: §r§fA Carrot King has been scaring off all the good fish, I need to deal with it before I lose more fish.
14:54:20 §e[NPC] §aFisherman§f: §r§fS'alright, we are all busy some days.
14:54:21 §e[NPC] §aTrevor§f: §r§fI've been tracking an animal for the past few days. Got anything I could use as bait?
14:54:25 §e[NPC] §aTrevor§f: §r§fLooks like I'll have to catch it the old fashioned way.
16:09:19 §e[NPC] §aJacob§f: §r§fHowdy! Fine barn ye got there eh? Good lad, you think ye could get me some wheat, eh?
16:09:21 §e[NPC] §aJacob§f: §r§fGosh darn it matey, can't believe ya do me like that, eh?
16:09:22 §e[NPC] §9Bartender§f: §r§fI want to make some new brews, do you think you can give me some ingredients to work with?
16:09:28 §e[NPC] §9Bartender§f: §r§fHard times we are in. Take care!
16:09:29 §e[NPC] §aShaggy§f: §r§fHey kid, I haven't seen you in a while. Arachne's powers are growing day by day. Soon she'll take over the §cSpider's Den§f.

16:09:32 §e[NPC] §6Jerry§f: §rHello §aHotBaconWasTaken§f. Glad to meet you here. I need some §9Enchanted Cookie§f.

16:09:51 §e[NPC] §6Clerk Seraphine§f: §r§fHey §aHotBaconWasTaken§f, the mayor elections are coming up and I've ran out of ballot paper! Could you help me out?
16:10:00 §e[NPC] §6Clerk Seraphine§f: §r§fThank you very much! I'll make sure to give these extra ballots to only the elites!
