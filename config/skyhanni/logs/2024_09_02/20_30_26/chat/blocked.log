20:48:21 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §aRyu§f: §r§fDid you know that there is a Garden Level? Increase it by hitting milestones or selling to customers like me!

20:48:40 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §9Seymour§f: §r§fWanting to buy something from me? I got some pretty fancy tuxedos for sale, for a price of a small fortune.
20:48:48 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §9Seymour§f: §r§f*sigh* You're missing out on some awfully fancy gear.
20:48:54 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §aGuy§f: §r§fOh man gee, that's awful man, call me when you got 'em alright?

20:56:40 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fI don't really have a sweet tooth, but chocolate is probably my favorite thing in this world. But the supply is really poor mostly because of the mines' lack of accessibility.
20:57:07 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fAmazing! I haven't eaten such chocolatey goodness in a long time...Maybe they should invest in that rusty old lift.

21:32:19 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §aAdventurer§f: §r§fExploring the whole wide world makes me hungry, I could take some fresh potatoes.

21:32:45 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §aWeaponsmith§f: §r§fToo bad, I guess I'll have to look for actual metal next time...
21:32:46 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §aAdventurer§f: §r§fDarn it, I'll have to find another farmer then.
