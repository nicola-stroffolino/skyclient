21:18:07 §e[NPC] §aAlchemist§f: §r§fBeen running low on my brewing supplies, Nether Warts are quite hard to come by these days.
21:18:10 §e[NPC] §aAlchemist§f: §r§fUnfortunate, I'll see if I can find some Nether Warts from someone else.
21:18:11 §e[NPC] §9Zog§f: §r§fI have a big problem. I lost my sense of taste, now I can't tell the difference between a melon and a cactus...
21:18:13 §e[NPC] §9Zog§f: §r§fMy tongue is hurting for some reason...
21:18:14 §e[NPC] §aEmissary Ceanna§f: §r§fThe King's favorite emissary is here to request potatoes for the King's great feast! 
21:18:17 §e[NPC] §aEmissary Ceanna§f: §r§fI will inform the King about this disgrace!
21:18:18 §e[NPC] §aWizard§f: §rWhere am I? Oh, it's you §aHotBaconWasTaken§f.
21:18:20 §e[NPC] §aWizard§f: §r§fI suppose that was expected. Not many people have enough potatoes to power a magical portal.
21:18:21 §e[NPC] §aOdawa§f: §r§fI'm supposed to collect some food for the village, the Kalhuiki people have been through a tough time recently.
21:18:24 §e[NPC] §aOdawa§f: §r§fI guess I'll have to turn up empty-handed.
