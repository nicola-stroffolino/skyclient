11:23:09 §e[NPC] §aLumber Jack§f: §r§fMy assistant is feeling off, and I think we could do with a hearty meal. Do you think you can help us out?
11:23:11 §e[NPC] §aLumber Jack§f: §r§fI thought you'd be more thankful for the sweet axe my assistant gave you.
11:23:12 §e[NPC] §aFisherman§f: §r§fA Carrot King has been scaring off all the good fish, I need to deal with it before I lose more fish.
11:23:15 §e[NPC] §aFisherman§f: §r§fS'alright, we are all busy some days.
11:23:15 §e[NPC] §aAlchemist§f: §r§fBeen running low on my brewing supplies, Nether Warts are quite hard to come by these days.
11:23:17 §e[NPC] §aAlchemist§f: §r§fUnfortunate, I'll see if I can find some Nether Warts from someone else.
11:23:18 §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fI don't really have a sweet tooth, but chocolate is probably my favorite thing in this world. But the supply is really poor mostly because of the mines' lack of accessibility.
11:23:22 §e[NPC] §9Gwendolyn§f: §r§fI helped you enter the Crystal Hollows so many times! Why won't you return the favor?
11:23:22 §e[NPC] §9Tammy§f: §r§fI've been planning to build a trap for unaware animals so I can hunt them more efficiently. I really need some cactus, preferably the ones with the biggest spikes!
11:23:26 §e[NPC] §9Tammy§f: §r§fYou can't tell me that you couldn't find a single cactus...
