12:21:44 §e[NPC] §aHungry Hiker§f: §r§fHello there, I seem to be stuck here with no good food to eat, could you bring me some square orange fruits?
12:21:46 §e[NPC] §aHungry Hiker§f: §r§fI guess I'll just go hungry then...
12:21:47 §e[NPC] §aTerry§f: §r§fAhoy, §aHotBaconWasTaken§f! People always tell me they like ice cream, but ice never really tastes like anything for me!
12:21:48 §e[NPC] §aTerry§f: §r§fI'll keep crunching on those ice cubes, maybe I am missing something.
12:21:49 §e[NPC] §9Lumina§f: §r§fI'm looking to make some Jack o' Lanterns to help light up the Crystal Hollows - maybe you can help me out?
12:21:53 §e[NPC] §9Lumina§f: §r§fNot a problem, thanks for your time anyways.
12:21:54 §e[NPC] §aOringo§f: §r§fHey, you got some wheat for my pets by any chance? Gotta keep those little monsters fed, haha!
12:21:56 §e[NPC] §aOringo§f: §r§fYou know how it is, they never stop eating haha, thank you very much!
12:21:57 §e[NPC] §aFriendly Hiker§f: §r§fI'm planning to head back into the gorge to fetch my hiker friend, but I'll need some meat to cook before I head in there.
12:21:58 §e[NPC] §aFriendly Hiker§f: §r§fThat's alright. I can always head into the Oasis to hunt down some sheep.
12:29:41 §e[NPC] §aOdawa§f: §r§fI'm supposed to collect some food for the village, the Kalhuiki people have been through a tough time recently.
12:29:42 §e[NPC] §aOdawa§f: §r§fI guess I'll have to turn up empty-handed.
12:43:21 §e[NPC] §6Madame Eleanor Q. Goldsworth III§f: §r§fI'm here to put a value on your farm. Bring me your fanciest crop.
12:44:30 §e[NPC] §6Madame Eleanor Q. Goldsworth III§f: §rTruly Magnificent! I value your farm at a minimum of §6120,000,100 §fcoins!
13:29:44 §e[NPC] §9Gold Forger§f: §r§fDo Golden Carrots taste different than normal ones? I've actually never tried one before so I am pretty curious how they taste.
13:29:46 §e[NPC] §9Gold Forger§f: §r§fThey would've probably tasted bad anyways...
13:29:46 §e[NPC] §aStella§f: §r§fThe amount of plots you can unlock here is perfect for a Co-op. So much space!
13:29:50 §e[NPC] §aFelix§f: §r§fYou won't be able to store any items in the Garden, you should keep them on your Private Island!
13:29:53 §e[NPC] §9Seymour§f: §r§fWanting to buy something from me? I got some pretty fancy tuxedos for sale, for a price of a small fortune.
13:30:25 §e[NPC] §aStella§f: §r§fGood choice!
13:31:01 §e[NPC] §9Seymour§f: §r§fWow, don't you look dashing with that! Pleasure doing business with you.
13:31:03 §e[NPC] §aFelix§f: §r§fUntil next time!
13:46:06 §e[NPC] §6Jerry§f: §rHello §aHotBaconWasTaken§f. Glad to meet you here. I need some §aEnchanted Baked Potato§f.
13:46:22 §e[NPC] §6Jerry§f: §r§fThis is not my realm. I must return. Thank you.
15:00:51 §e[NPC] §aGuy§f: §r§fHeard you may got some mushrooms...I've been looking for some...
15:00:52 §e[NPC] §aMason§f: §r§fI paid for one of Treasure Hunter's tips today and again, it only led me to a dirty shoelace. His tips are just not worth it...
15:00:55 §e[NPC] §aJamie§f: §r§fYou might have noticed that you can purchase additional plots within your Desk in the Barn!
15:00:56 §e[NPC] §9Puzzler§f: §r§f§d▲§2▼§ftriangle§2▼§d▶§5▲§ffood§3◀§5▲

15:02:14 §e[NPC] §aGuy§f: §r§fThank ya man, I knew I could trust you! These will come in good use!
15:02:16 §e[NPC] §6Pest Wrangler?§f: §r§f§7§oThe figure hands you a slip of paper.
15:02:32 §e[NPC] §6Pest Wrangler?§f: §r§f§7§oThe figure nods at you and shambles away.
15:03:23 §e[NPC] §9Puzzler§f: §r§f(⌐■_■)§a✌
15:03:25 §e[NPC] §aMason§f: §r§fMaybe if I continue buying his tips I'll hit the jackpot soon. Just gotta spend a little bit more...
15:36:27 §e[NPC] §aLeo§f: §r§fSadly you can't gather logs in the §bGarden§f, however there are plenty of crops here!
15:36:29 §e[NPC] §aOdawa§f: §r§fI'm supposed to collect some food for the village, the Kalhuiki people have been through a tough time recently.
15:36:31 §e[NPC] §aVex§f: §r§fI have an offer for you that you can't refuse.
15:36:33 §e[NPC] §aGeonathan Greatforge§f: §r§fI usually only work with Oil Barrels, but I'd like to try making some Biofuel from compost.
15:36:34 §e[NPC] §9Lumina§f: §r§fI'm looking to make some Jack o' Lanterns to help light up the Crystal Hollows - maybe you can help me out?
15:36:50 §e[NPC] §aGeonathan Greatforge§f: §r§fOil Barrels are far superior, but at least this is 100% renewable. Pretty neat!
15:36:58 §e[NPC] §aFelix§f: §r§fYou won't be able to store any items in the Garden, you should keep them on your Private Island!
15:38:03 §e[NPC] §9Lumina§f: §r§fNice doin' business with ya! Here's some copper in return.
15:38:04 §e[NPC] §aVex§f: §r§fTold you.

16:04:50 §e[NPC] §aLibrarian§f: §r§fGreetings! I've been running low on paper recently for my Enchanted Books, could you bring me some Sugar Cane?
16:05:36 §e[NPC] §6Pest Wrangler?§f: §r§f§7§oThe figure nods at you and shambles away.
16:05:57 §e[NPC] §aFriendly Hiker§f: §r§fThat's alright. I can always head into the Oasis to hunt down some sheep.
16:06:50 §e[NPC] §aLibrarian§f: §r§fI'll be sure to make some Enchanted Books out of these, I hope you come around some day!

16:35:13 §e[NPC] §aAlchemist§f: §r§fBeen running low on my brewing supplies, Nether Warts are quite hard to come by these days.
16:35:15 §e[NPC] §9Tammy§f: §r§fI've been planning to build a trap for unaware animals so I can hunt them more efficiently. I really need some cactus, preferably the ones with the biggest spikes!
16:35:17 §e[NPC] §aPest Wrangler§f: §r§fThere's pests everywhere. I can smell 'em in the walls!
16:35:19 §e[NPC] §aOdawa§f: §r§fI'm supposed to collect some food for the village, the Kalhuiki people have been through a tough time recently.
16:35:20 §e[NPC] §aOdawa§f: §r§fPerfect! I'll share the good news with my village!

16:35:46 §e[NPC] §aPest Wrangler§f: §r§fThanks mate, this should help me catch 'em!
16:36:38 §e[NPC] §aAlchemist§f: §r§fUnfortunate, I'll see if I can find some Nether Warts from someone else.
16:36:45 §e[NPC] §9Tammy§f: §r§fYou can't tell me that you couldn't find a single cactus...
16:37:07 §e[NPC] §aFriendly Hiker§f: §r§fThanks! I'll be heading to look for him as soon as possible.
17:03:57 §e[NPC] §aRhys§f: §r§fI found an unexplored cave while mining for titanium. But it's too dark to see in there, even for me! Can you spare any glowing pumpkins?
17:04:02 §e[NPC] §aRhys§f: §r§fWell then, I will even mine in total darkness if I must!
17:04:02 §e[NPC] §9Emissary Sisko§f: §r§fI've heard I can find the best mushrooms here, and as the King's favorite emissary I will bring them to him!
17:04:05 §e[NPC] §aLynn§f: §r§fIf you ever get lost, you should check on the Desk on what to do next.
17:04:11 §e[NPC] §aLynn§f: §r§fMaybe next time.
17:04:18 §e[NPC] §9Emissary Sisko§f: §r§fYou are going to regret this!
