12:21:47 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §aTerry§f: §r§fAhoy, §aHotBaconWasTaken§f! People always tell me they like ice cream, but ice never really tastes like anything for me!
12:21:48 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §aTerry§f: §r§fI'll keep crunching on those ice cubes, maybe I am missing something.
12:21:49 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §9Lumina§f: §r§fI'm looking to make some Jack o' Lanterns to help light up the Crystal Hollows - maybe you can help me out?

12:21:54 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §aOringo§f: §r§fHey, you got some wheat for my pets by any chance? Gotta keep those little monsters fed, haha!
12:21:56 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §aOringo§f: §r§fYou know how it is, they never stop eating haha, thank you very much!
12:21:57 [GARDEN_VISITOR_MESSAGE] §e[NPC] §aFriendly Hiker§f: §r§fI'm planning to head back into the gorge to fetch my hiker friend, but I'll need some meat to cook before I head in there.
